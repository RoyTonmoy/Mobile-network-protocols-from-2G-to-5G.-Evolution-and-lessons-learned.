Phishing Attack Using SigPloit:

1. Clone the SigPloit Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ethicalhackeragnidhra/SigPloit-ss7.git
  
   This will download the SigPloit-ss7 repository to your local machine.

2. Install Prerequisites:**
   Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
   - Python version 2.7
   - Java version 1.7 or higher
   - A Linux-based system

3. Set Up IP Addresses:
   Configure two IP addresses from the same network on localhost. This step is crucial for simulating attacks effectively.

4. Launch SigPloit:
   Navigate to the SigPloit-ss7 directory that you cloned earlier:
   cd SigPloit-ss7
   
   Run SigPloit using Python:
   python sigploit.py
   
   This command will start SigPloit and provide you with a menu to select and configure different attacks.

5. Select Phishing Mail Attack:
   In the SigPloit menu, select the option for Phishing Mail (Fraud) attack. This will initiate the process for launching a phishing attack using email.

6. Configure Phishing Parameters:
   SigPloit will prompt you to configure parameters for the phishing email, such as the sender's email address, subject, message content, and any malicious links or attachments.

7. Send Phishing Email:
   Once you have configured the phishing parameters, SigPloit will simulate sending the phishing email to the target email address.

8. Capture Results with Wireshark:
   Use Wireshark to capture the network traffic during the phishing attack. Configure Wireshark to filter and display email-related traffic, including SMTP and POP3 protocols.

9. Analyze Phishing Results:
   After sending the phishing email and capturing data with Wireshark, analyze the results to observe the email delivery, recipient's response, and any interactions with malicious links or attachments.

10. Review Output and Data:
    Examine the output in Wireshark after the phishing attack initialization to verify if the phishing email was delivered successfully and if any malicious actions were taken by the recipient.
