# Title: Mobile network protocols, from 2G to 5G. Evolution and lessons learned.

# Overview

This project focuses on exploring the evolution of mobile network protocols from 2G to 5G, understanding the security protocols used at different stages, studying various attacks on these protocols, especially focusing on the Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) protocol vulnerabilities, and implementing attacks on SS7 in an emulated environment.

# Project Objectives

1. Evolution of Mobile Networks
   - Describe the historical evolution of mobile networks from 2G to 5G.
   - Discuss key milestones, technologies, and advancements in each generation.

2. Security Protocols
   - Explain the security protocols used in different generations of mobile networks.
   - Discuss the evolution of security measures and standards over time.

3. Attacks and Deprecation
   - Describe various attacks on mobile network security protocols.
   - Explain why certain security protocols were deprecated due to vulnerabilities and attacks.

4. SS7 Protocol Vulnerabilities
   - Provide an in-depth explanation of the Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) protocol.
   - Discuss vulnerabilities in SS7 that allow tracking mobile phone users and intercepting 2FA texts.

5. Implementation of Attacks
   - Implement at least two attacks on SS7 protocols in an emulated environment.
   - Document the process, tools used, and outcomes of the implemented attacks.

# Prerequisites:

1. Python version 2.7
2. Java version 1.7 or higher
3. A Linux-based system
